                    <p>Welcome to my website! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo, currently studying Computer Engineering.
					 In my spare time, I enjoy coding, gaming, tinkering with electronics, going on adventures, and playing my saxophone.<br><br>
					 Here, you will find links to projects that I've worked on in the past, as well as things that I am currently busy with.
					 For employers, I have also included a link to my resume. :-)</p>
