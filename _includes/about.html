                    <p>Welcome to my website! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo, currently studying Computer Engineering. Here, you will find links to projects that I've worked on in the past, as well as things that I am currently busy with. For employers, I have also included a link to my resume. :-)</p>
